Hello! I am a physics PhD student at UC Berkeley.  I graduated Dublin Scioto HS in 2016 and Columbia University in 2020 with a major in physics and mathematics.

Here is  my [Resume](/resume/Yamakawa_Resume.pdf) and [CV](/resume/Yamakawa_cv.pdf)

## Teaching
I am currently a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for Fall 2020 PHYS 7B Physics for Scientis and Engineers.

- Fall 2020 GSI for PHYS 7B 

- Spring 2020 TA for PHYS 3008 

- Fall 2019 TA for PHYS 3007

In my free time I like to go to cafes and play taiko.
