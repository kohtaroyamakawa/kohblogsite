Finding a way to get through online classes whether you're a teacher or a student is important.  When you're on a few or 10 Zoom meetings a day, here's some things that helped me out in getting through.  On average, I spent around 15 hours a week teaching, another 10-15 hours of watching talks and lectures, and a few mor hours to hang out with friends.  Here's some tips and tricks to help you get through the day!

# 1. Optimize your setup.

If your wallet allows it, improve your setup.  Getting an ergonomic keyboard/mouse/chair/footrest is important to feel comfortable while working.  If weather permits, take a class outdoors. Being able to alternate different modes of taking in information is important to keep you on your toes and get the proper stretch you need.

# 2. Figure out how you are going to teach/learn

While having different modes of accepting information is important, too many degrees of freedom can distract you to no end.  If you have a dual monitor, try to focus on just one when a lecture is happening.  I go so far as turning off one of my monitors and locking my phone to try to concentrate on the lecture.  I still manage to find my phone in my hand looking at memes but definitely less frequently than before.

Sometimes, distracting yourself a bit helps too!  Another thing that helps me is, _turning on some music_.  Whether it be lofi hip hop beats or cafe jazz, something noisy in the background can help you wake up and concentrate on the task at hand.  I'm surprised how little people seem to do this, but it has gotten me through some of my evening obligations. Try to use instrumental music or music in a language you don't know so that you don't end up listening to the music and distracting yourself completely.  Also that way, the speaker can't see you singing the lyrics or bopping your head.  But maybe they'll think that their presentation is just that good.

# 3. Turn on your video! (if you can)

It's a very common among students to turn off your video.  Sometimes that's appropriate, wheteher I'm attending a class while making dinner or on a walk or not wearing all my clothes.However, from the teacher's perspective, lecturing to a blank screen is not only intimidating but soul crushing.  Anything that helps your lecturers have the will to continue pouring energy into their lectures is important and so I suggest that you put your video on if you can!

# 4. Take a break!
Take a break during lectures by getting up and stretching.  Take a break while you're  teaching to look outside and rest your eyes.  Take a break by skipping lecture and watching a recording later.  All of these are important in making sure that we can get up the next day or the next week to continue studying and working towards our dreams!

# Conclusion
Zoom sucks! COVID sucks!  Life sucks when you have to do all of your studying and research alone in your room.  But it sucks for everyone else too.  We'll be free soon (hopefully).
