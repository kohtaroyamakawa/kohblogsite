#COVID
I found myself coming back to this blog topic quite often.  I know that I should write on  it and see what my thoughts and feeling swere like at the time.  I hope to look back on this later in life and reflect on how the me now thinks.

#A Senior Year
We got kicked out of college.  Columbia told us they wouldn't kick us out like the poor students at Harvard and Cornell but after a few days (and a breakout in New Rochelle where a math professor lived), we were told to go home if possible.  I had the fortunate of having caring parents that could drive me home and friends that could take care of the large Taiko drums I had been storing in my room.  
We didn't get to say goodbye much.  I held a last get together with the CU Taiko friends but didn't get to say goodbye to all my friends.  It was odd not saying official goodbyes to people who were with me everyday for four years.  I think that I won't have closure on this undergraduate chapter in my life for a while.  

But after an extended spring break, we were back to work doing problem sets and lectures albeit from the comfort of our own homes.  I certainly took a lazy approach to life.  Even with senioritis kicking in and my graduate school decisions done, I definitely laid back even further.  Online electronic laboratory were done within 45 minutes regardless of quality.  I ran every day (thanks mom and dad).  I slept 10 hours a day.  I watched a movie and played pool from 7-11 PM every night.  Academics weren't really on my mind.

Of course, I still worked on in my Machine Learning and Advanced Statistical Mechanics courses.  I saw them more like therapy.  Thinking about the next problem set or deciphering a recent lecture would make all the pain and loss I felt go away.  I worked hard certainly.  But, I don't think it was all just for the content.

In some ways, it was nice.  I saw and talked to my family for what felt like the first time in four years.  I felt like my life had slowed down tenfold compared to the bustling schedule I kept up at Columbia.  I talked to old friends through videocalling.  My highschool friend group got together for beers for the first time in years.

But, in the end, we were in a global pandemic.  Every grocery trip was filled with more anxiety.  More news about friends or friends of friends contracting COVID.  Trickling rumours of horror stories in the ER.  We didn't know if we had to wash our groceries or see others for a walk or do takeout safely.  There was not much information out there and our family didn't take risks.  I saw the end of my undergraduate career flash by in a pre-recorded youtube video.  A door closed, and another door opens right?  It didn't feel that way.

#Summer Break

Myo riginal plans to travel to San Frncisco, and Los Angeles, and Hawaii, and Tokyo were dashed due to COVID.  I stayed inside and watched TV shows and read manga.  The refuge I had was in pouring into my research project with Professor Uemura.  We were close to finishing the paper but decided to do simulations.  AS my frist real computational research projec, I had fun learning how to efficiently compute, store, and graph data.  I ended using the Google Colaboratory cloud to do most of my computations mostly because I could save the data files inefficiently.  This way I could take advantage of the infinite storage in my Columbia google drive.

At times, it was frustrating to =be working on thes ame project as my freshman year.  But, I realized I was still learning a lot of things with every meeting I had and every paper I read.  It made me think that perhaps I really didn't understand this project at all before.  Whelp.

#Living in Berkeley
When I first came to Berkeley, I was very conservative.  I double masked with an N95 at the grocery store and tested every week.  My roommate was very insular and let me see my girlfriend.  We had fun together as a mini pod, ordering takeout and cooking and baking.  Sometimes I would go on socially distanced walks with a fellow graduate student and maybe eat out on the lawn but nothing more.  I met a very few number of people in person and I was happy.  

When spring came around, I got a different roommate who was more social than me.  I found myself being very critical of their outings.  He would go into cars with others (with the windows open and masked) or go out kayaking while masked.  All of these activities filled me with anxiety.

For the first time, I had to deal with the choices of another independent adult.  Another person who has their own social needs and wants out of life.  I questioned their desire to go out and experience new things like kayaking or fishing in Berkeley especially in the midst of the pandemic.  I still do.  

I soon realized I wasn't being fair.  I was seeing my girlfriend in person and as a part of their pod but was asking them to restrict their socially distanced and masked activities.  As someone with a girlfriend, my social needs were different as well.  But even with all this rationality, I still felt anxious.

At the end of February, I was invited out to play Taiko with the undergraduate group at Cal.  I saw that the cases in the area were decreasing, the vaccination coverage was increasing, and the prospect of playing Taiko outdoors in the sun exciting.  I went.  But even then, I feel like a hypocrite.

The me that is so critical of my roommate's activities, the me that was so careful for almost a year, so carelessly succumbing to playing outdoors with strangers.  It was a departure from what has become my new conservative approach to activities.  However, it is to be expected.

With improvements in cases, we will have to let go of the distanced mindset.  Soon, we will be able to ride the bus with comfort.  Soon, we will be able to take our masks outdoors.  And the time of transition from quarentining to "normalcy" is now.  With it will come anxieties in wondering if it is actually okay to come out of our shelters.  Looking back, it was quite easy giving up all the nice things in life to stay safe.  But returning to freedom from a place of a year's worth of anxiety is just as hard.

I want to see the data and know that it is okay to make the choices I make.  But no one is going to tell me what is okay or not okay to do.  There is not magic number that tells us that we will be okay.  Even now, variants continue to come out and these vaccines may not protect us from it all.  But deciding when and how to live my life while LIVING my life is a decision for me alone.

I want to see my girlfriend.  I want to make new friends.  I want to explore the world of Taiko on the west coast.  How I choose to do that in spite of the dangers in the world that afflict us today is up to me.
That scares me.
