I visited LA in the week of June 5th to June 12th and had a blast!  A few awesome Taiko things that happened:

* Stayed in Kris Bergstrom and Minh Nguyen's apartment and did jam sessions at his studio!
* Participated in a UnitOne practice with Jen Baik, Young Kang, Fred Visaya, and Yuta Kato
* Took a Hachijo and Odaiko/Naname/Yodan private lesson with Yuta Kato
* Took an Odaiko private lesson with Isaku Kageyama
* Took a Naname private lesson with Yeeman "Manman" Mui

My trip to LA was a new experience for many reasons.
