Learned and performed Jack Bazaar as part of Asano Taiko's Virtual Recital.  Had fun meeting Taiko enthusiasts from all over the world (Los Angeles, Berkeley, Little Rock, Calgary, Kawasaki, Buenos Aires) through online asynchronous lessons with Yuta Kato.  I believe this was Asano Taiko/LATI's first venture into complete virtual instruction.
