**Thoughts on my playing**:

* Keep head up during the oroshi
* Don't sway your hips so muchduring karaka
* M3 arm needs to be bigger loop
* Use more gravity to hit and less acceleration
* More ma during B section and more spacious rhythms
* Let the build be more flowy and less erratic
* More flashy/poses overall

Way better than before LA trip but not quite where I want to be.
