Some fun reviews I've received while teaching, the good and the bad but not too ugly.

# Physics 7B
### Praise
> In the beginning, God created Physics. But Physics was vicious, so God created Koh, the bastion of defense against all misunderstood attributes of thermodynamics and circuit boards. Koh is Love. Koh is Life. He is an extremely talented GSI who comes prepared every session with worksheets that are so helpful, even other GSIs steal them from him. He is approachable, and tells you things with a refreshing honesty, helping you succeed not by making it easier, but by making you better.

> Do I need to say anything else? Koh is the Chosen One, to bring balance to the bell curves of physics and to bring us towards salvation in the holy lands of the 90th percentile on testing and the nourish us with knowledge and power. His discussion sections were not supplements to lecture, but miniature lectures in themselves.

### Criticisms

> Slight lack of confidence
