I watched the Mio No hasu suite via live Youtube on March 13th, 2021.
"A Lotus on the Water Channel"), live from Shichigahama International Hall, Miyagi Pref.
This is a suite that was composed a long time ago.  It is described as,
The Mio no Hasu Suite uses the life story of Takumi Asakawa, a forestry scholar from the period of Japanese colonization of Korea as the theme. The suite is made up of independent pieces that come together to form a theatrical work, with an audust theme that illustrates the empathy between Man and Nature. It opens with a prelude by a single o-daiko, followed by the use of the Dengaku Taiko technique to complement the cutting-edge choreography of the images of the ancient deities "Yama Sachi", then a solo performance of an o-daiko to depict the praying and calling to the Universe, before the emergence of the deities "Umi Sachi" to show the interaction between human and Nature under the powerful waves of the ocean, bringing the work to a climatic close.
About Takumi and Noritaka Asakawa and their efforts to survey and preserve traditional Korean ceramics during Japan's pre-war occupation.
