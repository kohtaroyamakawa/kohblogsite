Under inspiration from the superb personal site of Kris Bergstrom, I'll start curating my first personal site on Taiko.  I don't aim really to give any instruction or information to any students but I might post some useful links and thoughts that I've had on my Taiko journey!

Documenting and publishing, albeit to an audience of measure zero, is a process that I want to immerse myself in both so that I can look back on my own progress in the future and maybe even organize my thoughts.
