I have taught many times over my twelve years of playing Taiko.  Whenever I teach, I like to think about the different ways to make good Taiko.  

I also have taken a lot of lessons.  I have gone far beyond just learning songs in lessons but trying to pick up different aspects of s tyles.  I like the flexible elastic nature of Yuta Kato's playing.  The neverending innovative rhythms in Eitetsu's style.  The quirky multi-tones explroed in Kris Bergstrom's work.  The avant-garde compositions of Tsuji Tasuku.  From each, I learn a new way to explore this thing called Taiko.  I record and look back on the abundance of subtlety in the reasonings behind their approaches and find a way to incorporate that into my won.  My goal is not to find the ``correct form''.  It is to learn as many ways possible to hit a drum and to settle on oone that I can call mine.  It need not be new, nor need it be innovative.  It needs only to be mine.

How does this differ from my experience in the classroom?
In teh classroom, you are expected to take notes and finish homework.  The homework that is set out for Taiko is different.  ONe needs to accomodate a new form or rhythm into one's muscle memory and make it feel, look, and become more natural.
